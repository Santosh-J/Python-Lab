To understand tensors well, itâ€™s good to have some working knowledge of linear algebra and vector calculus.
 You already read in the introduction that tensors are implemented in TensorFlow as multidimensional data arrays,
but some more introduction is maybe needed in order to completely grasp tensors and their use in machine learning.
