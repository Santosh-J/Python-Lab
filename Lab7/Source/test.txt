I FOUND HIM in Ponta Pora, a pleasant little town in Brazil, on the border of Paraguay,
in a land still known as the Frontier.
They found him living in a shaded brick house on Rua Tiradentes, a wide avenue with
trees down the center and barefoot boys dribbling soccer balls along the hot pavement.
They found him alone, as best they could tell, though a maid came and went at odd hours
during the eight days they hid and watched.
They found him living a comfortable life but certainly not one of luxury. The house was
modest and could've been owned by any local merchant. The car was a 1983 Volkswagen
Beetle, manufactured in Sao Paulo with a million others. It was red and clean, polished to
a shine. Their first photo of him was snapped as he waxed it just inside the gate to his
short driveway.
